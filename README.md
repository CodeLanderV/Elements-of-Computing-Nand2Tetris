"The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles", A book by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, Describes and explains the process of building a working 16bit computer using Nand2Tetris software. This is useful for computer science engineering studnets to understand the working of a computer from base level.

Everything starts from a Nand gate.

This github repository aims to show how to build a computer using nand2tetris.

As you browse through the files, you will find a Readme file in everyfile, explaining the contents.

HappyÂ Learning!
