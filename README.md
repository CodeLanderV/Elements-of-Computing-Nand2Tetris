# Elements of Computing and Nand2Tetris Project

"The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles," a book by **Noam Nisan** and **Shimon Schocken**, describes and explains the process of building a working 16-bit computer using the Nand2Tetris software. 

This is useful for computer science engineering students to understand the working of a computer from the base level.

Everything starts from a NAND gate.

The Nand2Tetris software (available [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software))

This GitHub repository aims to show how to build a computer using Nand2Tetris.

As you browse through the files, you will find a `README.md` file in every directory explaining the contents.

**Happy Learning!**
